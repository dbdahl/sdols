\usage{
salso(expectedPairwiseAllocationMatrix, loss = c("squaredError",
  "absoluteError", "binder", "lowerBoundVariationOfInformation")[1],
  nCandidates = 100, budgetInSeconds = 10, maxSize = 0,
  maxScans = 10, multicore = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{expectedPairwiseAllocationMatrix}{A \code{n}-by-\code{n} symmetric matrix
whose \code{(i,j)} elements gives the estimated expected number of times that items
\code{i} and \code{j} are in the same subset (i.e., cluster).}

\item{loss}{One of \code{"squaredError"}, \code{"absoluteError"}, \code{"binder"}, or
\code{"lowerBoundVariationOfInformation"} to indicate the optimization should seeks to
minimize squared error loss, absolute error loss, Binder loss (Binder 1978), or the lower
bound of the variation of information loss (Wade & Ghahramani 2017), respectively.
The first three are equivalent.}

\item{nCandidates}{The (maximum) number of candidates to consider.  Fewer than
\code{nCandidates} may be considered if the time in \code{budgetInSeconds} is exceeded.
The computational cost is linear in the number of candidates and there are rapidly
diminishing returns to more candidates.}

\item{budgetInSeconds}{The (maximum) number of seconds to devote to the optimization.
When this time is exceeded, no more candidates are considered.}

\item{maxSize}{Either zero or a positive integer.  If a positive integer, the
optimization is constrained to produce solutions whose number of clusters
is no more than the supplied value.  If zero, the size is not constrained.}

\item{maxScans}{The maximum number of reallocation scans after the intial allocation.
The actual number of scans may be less than \code{maxScans} since the algorithm stops
if the result does not change between scans.}

\item{multicore}{Logical indicating whether computations should take advantage of
multiple CPU cores.}
}
\value{
A clustering (as a vector of cluster labels).
}
\description{
This function implements the sequentially-allocated latent structure optimization (SALSO)
to find a clustering that minimizes various loss functions.
The SALSO method was presented at the workshop "Bayesian Nonparametric Inference: Dependence
Structures and their Applications" in Oaxaca, Mexico on December 6, 2017.
