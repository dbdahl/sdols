Recall my original partition distribution indexed by pairwise information
defined by modifying Neal's algorithm 8.  The prior distribution is the implied
target distribution of the Markov chain.

First, I should use this distribution in Brandon's project on clustering.

Second, I can do posterior inference in this modeling framework using ABC
sampling.  Recall that in ABC sampling we need to be able to simulate from the
prior distribution but do not need to be able to evalute its pdf/pmf.  This is
exactly my situation.
